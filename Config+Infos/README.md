# Config+Infos

for backup save and other config files and a lot about my setup

and information and notes about my setup
*(mostly written for me, but feel free to read it)*

## Name and Icon cfg

Change the name and the icon of windows drive or USB-Stick etc.
with a `autorun.inf` file.

```ini
[autorun]
icon=Icon.ico
label="117GB"
```

*see in the folder directory or click [here](autorun.inf)*

- **Icon** is the Foldericon
- **Label** is the drive name
