# Tauri Website App

This is a Template which lets you create easily a Tauri app for Website,
**but** this only with Internet because the App is just a redirection!


## To start!

Fork the Repository with **ALL** Branches! *IMPORTANT*

then switchz to branch `Tauri Website App Template`
and simply open

```sh
./src/index.html
```

then change the **url** this line which is `https://shadowdara.github.io/`
to another Website

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0.0;url=https://shadowdara.github.io/" />
```

then commit the changes on `Tauri Website App Template` and create a tag!

You can just copy the commands down below or run `create_app.sh`

```sh
git checkout Tauri Website App Template
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from Tauri Website App Template"
git push
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The Worklfow will create a new Release version of the Tauri App in the
Repository, this will eventually take a while!
